C-Sharp-XNA-TBS-Project
=======================

A turn-based-strategy-type project.

This is a prototype for a turn-based-strategy game that I worked on around 2010-2011.
The project was done in VS2010, with the XNA library that Microsoft has since abandoned.

It includes:
- Hexagonal tile-based random terrain generation.
- A* pathfinding with weights.
- Line-of-sight, fog-of-war and visibility-tracking.
- A rudimentary interface with little icons, menus, etc.
- A basic itemization / stats system.
- A basic main menu.
